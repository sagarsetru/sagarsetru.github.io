### About Sagar

I am a scientist with broad and ever growing interests. Physics, biology, machine learning, drug development, marketing, and crypto are areas where I have variously done research, worked, and built, sometimes professionally or academically, and other times as a hobbyist. I enjoy working with data, designing and conducting experiments, and using machine learning to help people and solve business and scientific problems. Always be learning.

You can see my published academic work at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1GEQv5gAAAAJ&hl=en), code repositories for various projects at [GitHub](https://github.com/sagarsetru), and my professional and academic history at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagar-setru/).

### Products

I made a Chrome extension, [Debiaser](https://github.com/sagarsetru/debiaser_chrome_extension), that recommends news articles related to the one you are reading, but from news sources across the political spectrum. It's for curious consumers of news who value diverse perspectives. At the moment, you have to download it locally to use it, but I plan to list it at the Chrome web store.

### Learning 

The best way to learn is to do, build, or teach. That said, I plan to update this section of my webpage with a longer list of the various resources I've used over the years that I found great for learning.

I'm a fan of Coursera. Here are the courses I've completed:

- Essential Causal Inference Techniques for Data Science  
- Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch  
- Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization  
- AI for Medical Prognosis  
- Drug Development  
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
