### About me

I am a scientist with broad and ever growing interests. Physics, biology, machine learning, drug development, marketing, and crypto are areas where I have variously done research, worked, and built, sometimes professionally or academically, and other times as a hobbyist. I enjoy working with data, designing and conducting experiments, and using machine learning to help people and solve business and scientific problems. Team projects are the most fun. Always be learning.

You can see my published academic work at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1GEQv5gAAAAJ&hl=en), code repositories for various projects at [GitHub](https://github.com/sagarsetru), and my professional and academic history at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagar-setru/).

### Products

I made a Chrome extension, [Debiaser](https://github.com/sagarsetru/debiaser_chrome_extension), that recommends news articles related to the one you are reading, but from news sources across the political spectrum. It's for curious consumers of news who value diverse perspectives. At the moment, you have to download it locally to use it, but I plan to list it at the Chrome web store.

### Tutoring

I work with select high school students interested in doing independent and interdisciplinary scientific projects related to machine learning, physics, and biology. I can also tutor for these and related subjects, as well as for standardized tests. If interested, reach out at sagar setru 2 at gmail dot com, no spaces, to discuss potential projects.
