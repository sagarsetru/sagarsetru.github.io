My name is Sagar Setru. I am a scientist with broad and ever growing interests: statistics and machine learning, biology, physics, human health, and cryptocurrency are areas where I have studied, worked, and built, either profressionally or as a hobby.

This webpage is under construction. You can see my academic work at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1GEQv5gAAAAJ&hl=en) and my professional history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagar-setru/).
