I am a scientist with broad and ever growing interests. Physics, biology, machine learning, health, and cryptocurrency are areas where I have variously done research, worked, and built, sometimes professionally or academically, and other times as a hobbyist. I enjoy working with data, designing and conducting experiments, and using machine learning to help people and solve business and scientific problems. Team projects are the most fun.

You can see my published academic work at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1GEQv5gAAAAJ&hl=en), code repositories for various projects at [GitHub](https://github.com/sagarsetru), and my professional and academic history at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagar-setru/).
